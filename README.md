This project utilizes the follow technology.

* Password prompt demonstrates use of a Javascript do-while loop to search an array of correct passwords. Allows further access to webpage if there is a match.

* Header with navigation options vertically aligned.  But via @media queries, switches to horizontal alignment for the navigation options beneath the header when viewport increases to 769px, and moves the navigation options to the same line as the header name when viewport sizes increases to 1025px and higher.

* Banner uses CSS @keyframes and :hover pseudo-class to animate logo when pointer hovers over it.

* Main content section with a "calendar" of monthly hits:

       * demonstrates use of flexbox to expand vertical mobile alignment into rows as increased viewport space allows.

       * demonstrates use of a JavaScript for loop to adhere to D.R.Y. programming and eliminate repetitive code.


I believe at least 3 of the above will meet the project requirements.

TO DO possibilities:

* For readability,   "1970" image beneath banner ideally will be replaced with an image that has greater spacing between images when tiled, or will be tweeked if possible to add more yellow space between them.

* Add a footer.

* Create functionality to the "About" navigation item to either direct to a short paragraph above the footer, or make visible a previously hidden content via javascript.

* General asthetic improvements in colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

* New item in nav bar to allow user to search by month and navigate to that month.

* Possibly add section at top of page that displays content from month 50 year's prior to current month (ie., November as the time of this README most recent edit) with a second column to the right that displays more info about the song, the artist, composer(s), etc.  Use javascript to update this content as calendar progresses, or as user selects another month.

* Playlist creation.
